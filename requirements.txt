# Installation Instructions:
# 1. Create virtual environment: python -m venv cv_tracking_env
# 2. Activate environment: 
#    - Windows: cv_tracking_env\Scripts\activate
#    - Linux/Mac: source cv_tracking_env/bin/activate
# 3. Install requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt
# 4. Download StrongSORT weights:
#    wget https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/deep-person-reid/releases/download/v1.3.0/osnet_x0_25_msmt17.pt
# 5. Ensure your YOLO model weights are in the correct path: model/best.pt

# Platform-specific notes:
# - On Windows, you might need to install Visual Studio Build Tools
# - On Linux, you might need to install additional system packages:
#   sudo apt-get update
#   sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-pip
#   sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-0 libsm6 libxext6 libxrender-dev libgl1-mesa-glx
# - For GPU support on Linux, install CUDA toolkit separately
