# Removed 'yaml' – it's NOT a real pip package

# Note: Some packages like 'collections', 'time', 'os', 'sys', 'argparse', 'json'
# are built-in Python modules and don't need to be installed via pip

# Optional: For advanced visualization

# Installation Instructions:
# 1. Create virtual environment:
#       python -m venv cv_tracking_env
#
# 2. Activate environment: 
#       - Windows: cv_tracking_env\Scripts\activate
#       - Linux/Mac: source cv_tracking_env/bin/activate
#
# 3. Install requirements:
#       pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# 4. Download StrongSORT weights (for person ReID models):
#       wget https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/deep-person-reid/releases/download/v1.3.0/osnet_x0_25_msmt17.pt
#
# 5. Ensure your YOLO model weights are in the correct path:
#       model/best.pt

# Platform-specific Notes:
# - On Windows:
#     - You might need to install Visual Studio Build Tools for compiling some packages.
#
# - On Linux:
#     - Install system-level packages (before pip install):
#         sudo apt-get update
#         sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-pip
#         sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-0 libsm6 libxext6 libxrender-dev libgl1-mesa-glx
#
# - For GPU support on Linux:
#     - Make sure you have installed the correct version of the CUDA toolkit compatible with PyTorch.
